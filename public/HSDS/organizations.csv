What is mutual aid?
Mutual aid is people working together to meet each other&rsquo;s material needs (food, housing, healthcare, etc). Mutual aid is different from charity and social services-- instead of replicating the hierarchy and control of non-profits and government programs, mutual aid efforts strive to be transparent, collaborative, and powered by the people. Mutual aid is political. Mutual aid projects recognize current systems as a fundamentally unjust, see the connections between our collective problems and various forms of oppression, and understand that building a more survivable society requires more than symbolic acts or pressuring government representatives-- it requires each of us to actively create the world we want to see.

Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education programs.

Advocacy
ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical research, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, state, and federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations.

Mentoring

What is mutual aid?
Mutual aid is people working together to meet each other&rsquo;s material needs (food, housing, healthcare, etc). Mutual aid is different from charity and social services-- instead of replicating the hierarchy and control of non-profits and government programs, mutual aid efforts strive to be transparent, collaborative, and powered by the people. Mutual aid is political. Mutual aid projects recognize current systems as a fundamentally unjust, see the connections between our collective problems and various forms of oppression, and understand that building a more survivable society requires more than symbolic acts or pressuring government representatives-- it requires each of us to actively create the world we want to see.

Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education programs.

Advocacy
ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical research, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, state, and federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations.

Mentoring
