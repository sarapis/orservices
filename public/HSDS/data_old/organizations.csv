Research
ACTS supports investigations that continually improve team science, integrating multiple disciplines across the full translational science spectrum: from population based and policy research, through patient oriented and human subject clinical research, to basic discovery. Our goal is to improve the efficiency with which health needs inform research and new therapies reach the public.

Education
ACTS is the academic home for the disciplines of research education, training, and career development for the full spectrum of translational scientists. Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education programs.

Advocacy
ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical research, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, state, and federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations.

Mentoring
ACTS will promote investigations and dissemination of effective models for mentoring future generations of translational scientists.

Our History
The Elaine Ellis Center of Health was founded in 2010 by the relatives of the late Elaine Ellis, who lost her battle with cancer in 1993.
She was the matriarch of her family and a vibrant presence in her community. Her kindness and passion to serve others who were less fortunate extended beyond her family and friends to anyone who was in need of food, shelter, advice, and good conversation. Though she is unable to see the fruit which her character produced, her legacy continues, and is the driving force behind the Center’s mission to serve others.

Mission Stament
Elaine Ellis Center of Health (EECH) is a Not-For-Profit Organization dedicated to providing affordable comprehensive, preventive, and primary healthcare services to individuals residing in public housing and the surrounding areas, regardless of their ability to pay. In so doing, we are committed to offering said services in a clean, safe environment, appropriate in meeting the healthcare needs of our target population. EECH also demonstrates social responsibility through the just use of resources.

We mobilize skilled and unskilled volunteers, invest financial resources, and, through our work together, transform people and properties. Our mission is rooted in the Jewish commitment to seek justice by engaging in acts of loving kindness. We welcome people of all faiths to share in our work to keep our communities diverse and vital.

Yachad continues to have a big impact twenty years later&mdash;by staying true to our original mission to preserve housing in DC and engage the Jewish and greater community in social justice work. We do this through partnerships with homeowners in our Single Family Home Repair Program. This program brings skilled workers and volunteer groups into area homes. Over the course of many months, a home's plumbing, electrical, drywall, and other infrastructure repairs are made. Yachad requires homeowners to participate in our Homeowner Education Workshops to learn home maintenance and financial planning skills. Many of Yachad's volunteers participate in Sukkot in Spring, a program in which synagogues and other Jewish community groups make repairs in a home alongside the homeowners.

Other volunteers throughout the year include semi-skilled volunteers through the Handymensch Program and skilled workers who donate money and/or services through Yachad's Neighbor to Neighbor Initiative. Families or groups of friends may also celebrate a special occasion by hosting a Mitzvah Party, in which they sponsor and participate in a home repair project. Over the summer, high school students participate in Yachad's Ramp it Up! program in which campers build an accessibility ramp for an individual with disabilities.

Additionally, Yachad's Faith to Faith Community Development Program brings together real estate professionals to provide expertise to community development projects by working in partnership with houses of worship and other nonprofits to renovate their community facilities to better serve the congregants and neighborhood residents.",info@yachad-dc.org,,,http://yachad-dc.org/,,4,,,,,"1258855549014937,1124787894447866",896191474881929,888398891117437,0,,,,,,
