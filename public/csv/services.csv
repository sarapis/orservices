Our housing law attorneys understand the importance of getting our clients effective and timely relief in matters such as eviction, housing code violations, the termination of housing subsidies, and the preservation of affordable housing. We represent clients in eviction cases in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of D.C. Superior Court and in administrative hearings to preserve housing subsidies and challenge unlawful rent increases. Legal Aid housing law attorneys also assist clients living with deplorable housing conditions by representing them in affirmative suits to obtain repairs. Recognizing the acute need for tenant representation in D.C. Superior Court, we established the Landlord Tenant Court-Based Legal Services Project in 2007 to provide legal assistance to tenants at the courthouse. In 2010, we also advocated for the creation of the Housing Conditions Calendar, designed to help tenants living in poor housing conditions bring repair claims to court. In 2015, Legal Aid, in collaboration with Bread for the City, Legal Counsel for the Elderly, and the D.C. Bar Pro Bono Center, launched the Housing Right to Counsel Project, which aims over the long term to offer a guarantee of representation to tenants in subsidized housing who are facing eviction and the associated risk of losing an invaluable housing subsidy and entering into long-term homelessness. In addition to individual representation, our housing law unit works to identify cases that could have a broad-based impact and to engage in advocacy on issues that affect a group of tenants or the operations of government agencies and the Court.","816235551756131,1284378916833442","https://www.legalaiddc.org/housing-law/","","","none","841905613386238,779743205099707,1139839930624727,1238748896910244,996413864069591,625977127820194","You can apply online, utilize walk-in intake hours, or call (202) 628-1161 for more information.","","","","","<a href=""tel:202-727-2132"">202-727-2132</a>&nbsp;(Fax)","1338861885602630,1338861885602631,1338861885602632,1338861885602633,1338861885602634,1338861885602635,1338861885602636,1338861885602776","","","1218467427350381,584258227889674","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weekly sessions provide youth and their families the space to process their experiences and discover their innate resilience. Resilient Scholars Project – School Based (RSP-SB) Services RSP-SB Services are grounded in evidence-based treatment models such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), play therapy, and mindfulness. The program empowers children and adolescents by highlighting their existing strength. Throughout the school year, RSP clinicians facilitate group and individual therapy services using games, art, experiential activities, writing, and other modalities that explain concepts to participants in developmentally appropriate ways. As part of RSP-SB Services, RSP clinicians also provide trainings to partner staff on incorporating trauma and bereavement informed practices into their environments. Resilient Scholars Project – Home Based (RSP-HB) Services RSP-HB Services are designed to supplement RSP-SB Services by engaging entire families in the treatment process. Using the trauma adapted family connections (TA-FC) model, RSP clinicians also aim to help families improve access to needed resources, increase safety skills, reduce youth absenteeism from school, and/or improve youth grades over a period of six months. RSP clinicians build on the treatment models used in RSP-SB Services by incorporating principles from narrative therapy, motivational interviewing, and family systems therapy to work toward goals established with each family. By participating in activities, games, and conversations that help families learn about trauma/loss, families also work toward improving communication and family cohesion.","851341569805212,1270081732081180","https://www.wendtcenter.org/c-h-i-l-d-resilient-scholars/","","1","none","","To become a client, please call: 202.204.5021","","","","","<a href=""tel:(202) 204-5021"">(202) 204-5021</a>","840625194332248","","","921726586005599,1071169939843667","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Health Home services are provided by an inter-disciplinary team of primary and behavioral health professionals in conjunction with the consumer and others as identified by the consumer. The Health Home uses a team-based, person-centered approach, where staff collectively uses their skills and knowledge, to ensure that culturally and linguistically competent evidence-based services and supports are employed to address the overall health and wellness of each consumer.

"758678154564108","The Day Center","","785453766981777","At the Day Center, we promote mental, physical, spiritual and emotional healing through a holistic, integrated and evidence-based treatment approach. We provide trauma interventions, mindfulness and art therapy to help improve outcomes in the clients we serve. Patients can achieve a lasting recovery with support from peers and a highly trained staff. Intensive Outpatient & Partial Hospitalization Program Both the IOP & PHP programs offer a structured daily schedule consisting of evidence-based group therapy and a variety of hands-on art therapy, recreation and expressive activities. We help adults experiencing mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, bipolar diagnoses, or anxiety return to a healthy daily routine that incorporates self-care, social interaction, and mindfulness. The Partial Hospitalization Program provides an intense, structured treatment setting for individuals who would benefit from daily therapeutic interventions or who would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care. Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP) Intensive Outpatient clients come to the PIW Day Center from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm three days a week for psychiatric services and group therapy sessions. While multiple groups are offered licensed clinicians work with each IOP client to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the client’s strengths, diagnosis and identified opportunities for growth and skill building. During treatment, patients generally attend 3 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the client’s treatment plan. Partial Hospitalization Treatment (PHP) The Partial Hospitalization Program runs five days per week, five hours each day 9:00am to 2:00pm, plus a 30 minute lunch break. Each day: Begins with a community meeting group to review the daily schedule Welcomes any new individuals Reviews progress on treatment goals Addresses any concerns or challenges During treatment, patients generally attend 4 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the patient’s treatment plan. Trauma Recovery & Empowerment Model The Day Center at PIW utilizes an evidence based approach called The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). TREM is a fully manualized, group-based intervention designed to facilitate trauma recovery among women with histories of exposure to sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Drawing on cognitive restructuring, psychoeducational, and skills-training techniques, the intervention emphasizes the development of coping skills and social support. It addresses both short-term and long-term consequences of violent victimization and neglect, including mental health symptoms, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. Mindfulness The Day Center at PIW utilizes the practice of Mindfulness to support clients in their healing. Mindfulness is an integrative, mind-body based approach that helps people to manage their thoughts, feelings and mental health. It has become widely used in a range of contexts to support emotional health and awareness. Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment, using techniques like meditation, breathing, and yoga. Training helps people to become more aware of their thoughts, feelings and body sensations so that instead of being overwhelmed by them, they are better able to manage them. Practicing mindfulness can give more insight into emotions, boost attention and concentration as well as improve relationships.","908423552645976","https://psychinstitute.com/treatment-services/adults/the-day-center/","","1","none","893915418546777,1276982655382389,874406320909098","PIW’s Day Center Program has evidence-based treatment and skill enhancement to improve a person’s ability to function in daily life.

All scientific studies refer to the need to continue using the mind to prevent diseases related to memory loss. And that's why at VIDA we offer all kinds of classes: embroidery, weaving, art, music, dance, zumba, English, Spanish, jewelry, computing, among other specific trainings. We believe that happiness is built with small daily illusions, and with personal satisfaction. And then we focus on reinforcing the self-esteem of participants. On the other hand, we believe that being with friends doing all these things helps a person to feel better. Being able to share with other older adults and have a place where they feel welcome is an essential element in the elderly. That is why VIDA offers, in addition to all its classes, a whole package of recreation and socialization activities, such as walks, birthday celebrations, parties, group dances, and other activities and festivities that vary weekly.

And being a poor older adult in Washington DC is a huge challenge, largely because of the price of rentals in the city. In addition, Hispanic older adults never knew about the social benefits offered by the federal or city government, and even when they know there is some benefit, it is difficult for them to apply for the benefit because they cannot read the documents that They explain the benefits, cannot fill out the forms, or do not know how to follow those procedures. To face this tangle of procedures, Vida has a Social Services Counselor. All participants of Vida Senior Centers receive help from our counselors to apply for affordable housing, transportation and social benefits for programs that benefit older adults. With regard to immigration procedures, VIDA not only helps participants to start and follow-up on their migration processes, but also offers a weekly “Citizenship Class” in which participants are prepared to take the Citizenship exam.

Participants are offered the opportunity to sign a lease on an apartment of their choosing that best meets their familial, financial and safety needs, made possible by the relationships DASH has established with landlords across the city. DASH provides a rental subsidy, along with intensive supportive services and resources, so the individuals and families can become financially independent over the course of two years.

After two years (or sooner), participants are poised to take over full financial responsibility of their apartment.

Providing families with stable, safe housing is the first and most important step in accomplishing our mission of ending family homelessness. Housing Up follows the Housing First model, which focuses on quickly moving families experiencing homelessness into permanent housing with leases in their own names. Once families are safely housed, Housing Up’s comprehensive support services help transition families from homelessness to housing and economic stability. Housing Up case managers takes a holistic, family-centered approach to provide services, working with the entire family (including children) to develop individual and family goals and measure progress. Our program staff provides resources and guidance on employment, education and physical/mental health. Housing Up families experience a wide array of barriers that frequently impede job retention, which in turn disrupts family and housing stability. We know that providing job readiness training and education alone does not ensure a family’s success without other support. Our case management team helps to address these life issues, which can include transportation, finding reliable and affordable childcare and accessing resources for special needs children.","","https://housingup.org/ending-homelessness/case-managment/","","1","none","891529659623486,841905613386238,982549491856586,629380122005095,915117964681420","Families experiencing homelessness should contact the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VW) at (202) 526-0017 or visit them at 920 Rhode Island Avenue NE, DC to be referred to serivces.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Project was named for its founding Director, Barbara McDowell, after her untimely death. The Project not only litigates appeals on behalf of Legal Aid clients but also files “friend of the court” briefs on cases involving matters of importance to people living in poverty. Beyond litigation, the Project provides appellate instruction, consultation, and advice to the larger D.C. legal services community. Although most of the Project’s work involves cases before the District’s highest court – the District of Columbia Court of Appeals – the Project also gets involved in administrative appeals and cases before the District of Columbia Superior Court and the federal courts. Learn more about Barbara McDowell, the renowned appellate litigator and U.S. Supreme Court advocate who served as the project’s first director and after whom our appellate advocacy project is named. After Barbara’s untimely death, Legal Aid created the Barbara McDowell Endowment Fund for Appellate Litigation with funds donated both from Barbara’s estate and from the generous donations of her husband, Jerry Hartman. The Fund was created “to honor the immeasurable contributions that Barbara made to Legal Aid and the legal needs of persons living in poverty in the District of Columbia.” Jerry has continued to donate generously in Barbara’s honor to the Fund to sustain the ongoing, important work of The Barbara McDowell Appellate Advocacy Project. Jerry also founded The Barbara McDowell and Gerald S.

We offer drug and alcohol-free residential settings that use the influence of the community consisting of treatment staff and those in recovery, as key agents of change. In addition to using the concept of community as treatment method, the TC employs the principle of “self-help.” Self-help implies that the individuals in treatment are the main contributors to the change process. “Mutual self-help” means that individuals also assume partial responsibility for the recovery of their peers – an important aspect of an individual’s own treatment. The stages of treatment reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility. We use a variety of group processes to help individuals learn and assimilate social values and develop more effective social skills. Our TC is centered on cultural values. Recognizing that a client’s culture is an inseparable part of his or her self-image, we provide clients information to combat what Dr. Carter G. Woodson* described as the “mis-education” that has shaped their lives. This information is vital in helping clients to clarify who they are and to place themselves as worthy citizens. Our cultural teaching is based on respect and support of all individuals and their communities. *Dr. Carter G. Woodson created what we now know as African American History Month.

While most homeless services agencies provide housing counseling through case management, our dedicated Housing Services team provides specialized, direct services to our families separate from case management. Through formal and informal assessment strategies, Housing Up’s housing coordinators evaluate families’ barriers to housing and develop housing plans that take families’ needs and goals into consideration. Housing coordinators identify new rental units for families, negotiate leasing agreements with landlords and oversee travel arrangements for families moving into a new apartment. The Housing Services team supports families throughout the housing process, including: Housing Assessment and Planning Housing Search Assistance Lease-Up and Move-in Assistance Once families are stably housed, the team provides ongoing education and training to help families maintain stable housing. Key areas of education include basic apartment maintenance, household management and credit repair.","","https://housingup.org/ending-homelessness/housing-services/","","1","none","1305774265925553,841905613386238,982549491856586,629380122005095,915117964681420","Families experiencing homelessness should contact the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VW) at (202) 526-0017 or visit them at 920 Rhode Island Avenue NE, DC to be referred to serivces.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"795787284434998","Lead Pipe Replacement (LPRAP)","","698337947812895","In the District, like in most older cities, homes built before the 1980’s were typically built with a lead service line—the pipe that connects the city water supply to your household plumbing. It is now widely understood that a number of illnesses and injuries can be caused by lead exposure. The District Government recognizes this and in response Mayor Bowser signed legislation for two new lead water service line replacement programs that assist homes affected by this environmental hazard: 1. Full Lead Pipe Replacement In October, 2019, the District transferred $1 million to DC Water to cover the complete cost of the lead water service pipe replacement on private property when DC Water replaces the portion of lead pipe in public space during a Capital Improvement Project (i.e., water main replacement). NOTE: Customers do not need to apply to this program and DC Water will contact you if there are any planned projects in your neighborhood. If both the public and private portions of the service line are lead and no capital improvement is scheduled for two years, property owners can enroll in the Voluntary Lead Service Pipe Replacement Program. Applications will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis and this program is subject to the availability of funding. 2. Private-side Partial Lead Pipe Replacements In Fiscal Year 2020 (October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020), the District has allocated $1.8 million dollars to provide assistance for the replacement of lead pipes on private property if the pipe in the public space is not lead. The Lead Pipe Replacement Assistance Program (LPRAP) uses District funds to assist with eligible property owner’s lead pipe replacement. Each property owner can receive 50% of their costs covered (up to $2,500), regardless of income. Some residents will qualify for 80% or 100% assistance depending on household size and income. NOTE: DO NOT START WORK until your application has been approved and you have received a benefit confirmation letter. DO NOT pay a deposit to the contractor.","670763981366130","https://doee.dc.gov/node/1429846","leadline.replacement@dc.gov","1","none","929932272422839,824666532982332,1145222996317036","The determine your eligibility, search your address at https://www.dcwater.com/leadmap.

In addition, we have an Argentine Internist doctor, who supports this same task in our VIDA-Brightwood Meal-Site. As part of the Health Promotion program, our counselors routinely check the participants who register daily: their pressure is measured; their blood sugar levels are monitored; and their vital signs are supervised. Due to the high preparation of our counselors, when it is detected that the participant requires a medical appointment, the participants are referred to an appointment with their primary doctor or the needed specialist, if the case requires so. VIDA works with 7 hospitals in the city to which our counselors refer the participants when necessary. If the participant needs it, our social service counselor helps the participant to make the medical appointment. Sometimes the language barriers require this type of support. We also have a medication monitoring program to teach participants to know the benefits and side effects of the medications they take, so that they can understand the impact of their medications and identify if there is a problem. As part of the “Medication Monitoring Program”, a personalized follow-up of each person who enrolls in the program is carried out and a medication organizer pill is provided free of charge, so that they learn to take their medications on time and also learn to realize when they forget to take their pills. Likewise, VIDA also offers two weekly classes on common chronic diseases in older adults. Finally, Vida Senior Centers complements health education with the promotion of physical activity. VIDA offers arthritis exercise classes, chair exercise classes, dance and zumba classes, and yoga classes for seniors at its two locations. In summary, the activities offered by VIDA as part of the Health Promotion Program are the following: • Daily monitoring of vital signs • Diabetes Monitoring • Weekly Chronic Disease classes in the Elderly • Drug Adhesion Monitoring • Training on how to be regular with medications • Reference to medical consultations if necessary • Support to make appointments with your doctors.","932502301190120,869647738071923","http://box2142.temp.domains/~vidasen1/health-promotion-and-wellness/","","1","none","1276982655382389,885604845315230,819562758416858","Call to join the center.","","","","","<a href=""tel:202 - 483 - 5800"">202 - 483 - 5800</a>","1157784454037653","","","965942365087326,948986432487608","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our Workforce Development Program is a holistic, intensive, and highly personalized approach to preparing adults to enter the workforce and advance in their careers. As with all our efforts to end poverty, our workforce readiness programming is rooted in the power of connections. Partnerships with community employers are key to connecting job seekers with jobs and area businesses with excellent staff members. Boot Camps and Workshops DSC_0242 cropOur intensive, 40-hour Boot Camp combines career planning with the “soft skills” that employers seek. Topics include goal setting, conflict resolution, and phone etiquette, as well as hands-on support and practice with resume writing, cover letters, and interviewing. Following the Boot Camp, each job seeker is paired with a job coach from the community. Boot Camp workshops are held six times a year at A Wider Circle’s Professional Development Center For job seekers who cannot attend our Boot Camp (and for Boot Camp graduates who would like a refresher), we offer workshops and one-to-one job search assistance appointments during which participants get personalized attention from volunteers.

The Representative Payee Program (RPP) provides payee services, under a contract with the DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), to consumers with chronic mental illness who are referred by a case manager of DBH or an affiliated Core Service Agency. The Representative Payee Program helps DBH clients manage various types of income, including Social Security benefits (retirement or disability), Supplemental Security Income, and Civil Service Pensions. Forms from our Representative Payee Program may be found in the Social Services Documents. What is a Representative Payee? A Representative Payee is an individual or an organization designated to receive disability benefits on a client’s behalf. The Representative Payee then helps the client to budget the money and disburses the funds to pay for current needs, including housing and utilities, food, medical expenses, personal care and clothing. The Representative Payee must keep records of how the client’s money is spent. This information is reported regularly to the Social Security Administration or to the Office of Personnel Management. How does the Representative Payee Program work? Clients enrolled in Bread for the City’s Representative Payee Program work with their mental health service providers and Bread for the City staff to make sure that all of their financial needs are met. The client’s case manager at the DC Department of Behavioral Health or a DBH affiliated Core Service Agency makes an initial referral to Bread for the City for payee services. The client is enrolled at a start-up meeting with the case manager and a Representative Payee Program staff member during which we discuss how the services work. After enrollment, Bread for the City applies to the Social Security Administration or Office of Personnel Management to become the client’s Representative Payee. The client and his or her mental health case manager meet regularly to set and review the client’s monthly budget and discuss any emergency spending requests. Bread for the City relies on the case manager to be in regular contact with the client and keep Bread for the City informed about changes in the client’s needs that might affect the budget or benefits. Contacting the Representative Payee Program The RPP can be reached by phone at 202.386.7016 – the Program Assistant is able to answer many questions about the status of client accounts and requests. The program assigns a RPP Coordinator to work with the clients and staff based on the DBH provider where the client is enrolled.","839573866990556","https://breadforthecity.org/social-services/","","2","none","","Call the Department Phone Line","","","","","<a href=""tel:(202) 386-7016"">(202) 386-7016</a>","","","","1240791864033331","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"890516898015838","Gender Development Program","","1121342754860910","A Multidisciplinary Program for Gender-Diverse Youth and Their Families Some young people feel, sense or know they are a gender different than the one they were assumed at birth. They may live and dress in ways typical of another gender (gender non-conformity), and some may experience the need to live and be affirmed as this gender in some or all settings. This can be an urgent need, or for others, there may be experimentation and exploration. There are also some young people who show gender non-conformity in their everyday behaviors, but may not yet have the self-advocacy skills to discuss their gender identity and their gender-related needs. Each child's gender journey is unique. The gender development of a child may be confusing to parents and families, providers, and sometimes young people themselves. Parents may wonder: How can my child's gender-related needs best be supported? How do we navigate our child's gender diversity in everyday life (e.g., with family, in school, when moving into adulthood, etc.)? Is my child transgender? Will my child's gender and gender-related needs change over time? The needs of gender-diverse youth are often complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and ongoing care supports over time. About Us The Gender Development Program at Children's National has been supporting the gender needs of youth and their families for the past 20 years. As one of the earliest founded youth gender programs, we are a multidisciplinary team of specialists who work in the assessment and broad care needs of youth on the gender spectrum and their families. We also conduct cutting-edge research to move forward our understanding of youth gender development and ways to best support gender-diverse and transgender youth. Research findings inform all of our clinical care. We work with gender exploring, gender non-conforming, gender dysphoric, gender non-binary, transgender and gender-questioning young people, and we see children and adolescents of all ages. We also work with youth who have genetic and other conditions in which gender variation is common. We offer: Personalized evaluations and tailored care: This includes evaluation of your child's gender development and needs in the real world. Throughout care with us, your child will receive supports tailored to their unique needs, in coordination with an existing community of professionals your child already sees to ensure continuity and consistency of care. Comprehensive services and collaboration with multiple specialties: From initial and ongoing evaluation and support to specialists in medical treatments such as Veronica Gomez-Lobo, M.D., a pediatric gynecologist who provides medical interventions such as puberty suppression or hormone therapy, the program offers a full spectrum of care options based on the needs of each young person. Unique programs for diverse needs: Children and teens who have both autism spectrum characteristics (or related conditions) and gender dysphoria have access to a support program designed specifically for them: the Gender and Autism Program led by John Strang, Psy.D. Many providers refer patients to our program to access these services, which may not be offered elsewhere. The Gender Development Program works closely with the Youth Pride Clinic, which offers primary and specialty care services to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer) patients. Evaluation and Ongoing Supports Your child’s care will start with an initial evaluation by our team. During this two to three-hour visit, you will meet the team together with your child and also separately. The goals of these visits vary from family to family and may include: Understanding the various aspects of your child’s gender development Screening for any mental health concerns/risks Support for parenting a gender diverse child Support for families navigating issues related to siblings, friends, school, etc. We may ask you and your child to return for periodic follow-up visits. These visits can help us make a more extended evaluation. Your team also may suggest treatments or supportive services through Children’s National or in the community such as: Individual supports for youth and/or parents Family-specific supports School supports/interventions Support groups for you and/or your child","908942274584388,972271189983680","https://childrensnational.org/departments/gender-development-program","","1","none","1276982655382389,969114221652955,982549491856586,1091485627676359","Call or visit website to make an appointment or refer a patient.","","","","","<a href=""tel:(202) 476-5980"">(202) 476-5980</a>","649151581271820,683742989703803","","","1069203720699078,786143725434715","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison to curative care, which is meant to cure a disease, palliative care is meant to make the patient more comfortable. The definition of palliative care is ""to make a disease or its symptoms less severe or unpleasant without removing the cause."" Palliative care will lessen or ""palliate"" the symptoms and improve your quality of life. At VITAS, palliative care begins with a plan uniquely tailored by an interdisciplinary team to meet the needs of the patient. The team can work with newly diagnosed patients and those struggling with the effects or after-effects of curative therapies. Some members of the palliative team may be board certified in hospice and palliative medicine; others range from chaplains to social workers. A palliative consult with the patient provides timely and specific information that helps the patient and family understand what palliative medicine brings to the table and helps physicians and the rest of the interdisciplinary team provide the most appropriate care. If the patient’s symptoms escalate and can no longer be managed by routine palliative care, VITAS is available 24/7 to transition the patient to a higher level of care with round-the-clock support from a crisis nurse until symptoms are back under control. If symptoms are especially aggressive, VITAS can transfer the patient to an inpatient hospice unit for intensive symptom management until they’re ready to return home.","","https://www.vitas.com/care-services/palliative-care","","1","none","893915418546777,1269871832519469","Call the 24/7 line for more information.","","","","","<a href=""tel:(855) 402-3645"">(855) 402-3645</a>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exposure to this type of violence is also the greatest indicator that a child will grow up to find himself or herself in a violent relationship – as either the abuser or abused. Last year, more than 90% of the families served in Sanctuary Plus moved to more stable, safe homes. They did not become homeless, return to their abusers, or move to another short-term shelter program – draining a very limited resource.","","https://mysistersplacedc.org/programs-services/","info@mysistersplacedc.org","1","none","1169956847122981,1305774265925553,625144853335827,646077810643985","If you are a victim of domestic violence, you may be a candidate for Sanctuary Plus.

Even though most parents want what is best for their children, today about 1,300 District children are in foster care because of abuse and neglect within their family.

Thousands more are at risk because of homelessness, extreme poverty, or a family history of violence that can sometimes overwhelm parents and lead to neglect. Children’s Law Center advocates for these children. Often, we were appointed by judges in the District court to represent a child who had been abused or neglected or whose parents were fighting over custody. We also worked with many aunts, uncles, grandparents and other caring adults to keep children out of the foster care system and provide them with a familiar home.

Working collaboratively allows us to foster change on the local, state, and even federal levels – and at the same time, partnering organizations are more likely to refer at-risk youth to Covenant House.","1205691016832902","http://covenanthousedc.org/our-services/outreach/","","1","none","893915418546777,1091485627676359","Call or walk in for more information.","","","","","<a href=""tel:(202) 610-9600"">(202) 610-9600</a>","1287674050055454","","","1097680104175753","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When participants come to Misler for a day of enriched activities, families know that their family member is in a supportive and stimulating environment. They also know that they can take a much needed break while their older family member is at the Center. Our families regularly tell us how grateful and relieved they feel once their loved one is attending Misler. The respite from their own caregiving responsibilities means that they will be better able to provide needed care at home. Social work staff also supports caregivers through their knowledge of community resources to help families with their caregiving responsibilities. Whether it is a referral to a community based professional such as a neurologist, or a roster of credible home care agencies, we are there to help you meet the needs of your loved ones, today and in the future. We draw on the resources of JCA programs such as the Senior HelpLine or Connect-A-Ride Information and Referral to link families to the services they need. Our social workers lead a caregiver support group that meets twice a month. Under the gentle facilitation of our licensed social worker, families find a haven – a place to talk with others who are experiencing very similar challenges. Caregivers share ways to cope and manage the stresses in their lives. There is much talk, laughter and tears as caregivers connect to those who really understand. For information about caregiver support, call us at 301.468.1740 or use this contact form to send an email inquiry. The best way to appreciate the Misler Center is to see it for yourself. We encourage you to call to schedule a visit so you can see us in action – our dedicated and caring staff, our stimulating activities and the difference we are making in the lives of our participants each and every day.","1178988249328078","https://accessjca.org/misler-center/","Misler@AccessJCA.org","1","none","893915418546777,1010831804503850","For more information, to arrange a visit, or to speak with one of our social workers, please call us at 301-468-1740, or use the contact form on our website to send an email inquiry.","","","","","<a href=""tel:(301) 255-4200"">(301) 255-4200</a>","555815549467205,611883390595454,911518512626244,820929325093657","","","633831411141650","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These older neighbors are unable to play an active role in society because of their homebound status, which results in them becoming ""invisible"" and, consequently, this all too often leads to situations in which they are taken advantage of because of their decreased mobility and limited support network. Project HELP utilizes a full-time staff attorney, para-professional support, volunteers, and a cadre of volunteer (pro bono) attorneys from private law firms and government organizations. - Interview clients at home regarding legal problems; - Draft or review legal documents that seniors may need, such as powers of attorney or wills; - Administer a public-benefits checkup; - Assist clients with securing and maintaining public benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Elderly and Persons with Physical Disabilities (EPD) Waiver, Medicare, Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. - Assist clients whose benefits or services have been threatened with termination, terminated, decreased or overpaid, through representation at all stages of the appeal process including personal conferences, requests for reconsideration, and fair hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). - Analyze their housing situation concerning any landlord problems or consumer problems or, in the case of homeowners, any problems with home repair, predatory lending or deed fraud; - Ensure proper follow-up on the identified legal problems either directly or via LCE’s other program initiatives. Volunteers We are always looking for volunteers! We have a special need for attorneys and notaries, but anyone can volunteer to serve as a witness when we finalize important documents in seniors' homes.

"1003127511248132","Integrated Health","","643509042901798","As Pathways to Housing DC has evolved over the past fifteen years, so too has the national landscape of healthcare services. Individuals served by the public mental health system are dying, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population. This is largely due to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, and other obesity- and smoking-related diseases. These illnesses are worsened by years of malnutrition, living out in the harsh elements, and limited access to preventive health care. Pathways to Housing DC originated as a mental health and substance abuse provider. We have grown our partnerships with primary care providers and other local nonprofits over the past few years, recognizing that physical health and mental health are inextricably linked. We are committed to growing life expectancy and improving the health of the individuals we serve. Timely access to healthcare and health education greatly impact an individual’s ability to recover, live longer, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We currently provide integrated mental health and primary care services to all Pathways clients through an on-site, walk-in clinic via our partnership with Unity Health Care (the District’s largest Federally Qualified Health Center). The program has impacted the lives of the people we serve by increasing their awareness of, and adherence to, healthy behaviors and independence in managing their healthcare needs. We have seen an increase in the number of preventive care visits, a decrease in emergency department visits, an increase in the percentage of clients linked to primary care providers, an increase in adherence to diabetes management and regular lab work for clients with diabetes and pre-diabetes, an increase in adherence to follow-up medical appointments and medication, an increase in healthy eating, an increase in social support and a decrease in substance use. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that the people we serve are empowered and able to live longer, healthier and more hopeful lives.","940988880402930","https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/integrated-health/","","1","none","1276982655382389,629380122005095","Call to make an appointment.

People with disabilities have many issues and concerns in common, including transportation, health care, jobs, safety, adult education, and others issues. After a popular adult education program was threatened with closing without notice, students gathered together to protest the budget cuts and quickly learned that there is strength in numbers! They learned they can accomplish more together than alone. This strong community of self-advocates shares personal experiences of living with developmental disabilities – training and encouraging their peers to speak out on issues important to them. The groups motto, “Nothing About Us without Us,” is one Quality Trust fully endorses. Many members have joined boards, committees, work groups, and commissions that make decisions that affect their lives. Self-advocates meet to learn about their rights, update each other on important issues and events, practice speaking up and sharing their opinions, learn how to lead meetings, set priorities, provide and receive training and celebrate their achievements.","1250362245990206","https://www.dcqualitytrust.org/families/join-project-action/","pholton@dcqualitytrust.org","1","none","893915418546777,1292438606384099,982549491856586","Project ACTION! meetings are held on Saturdays at Kennedy Institute of Catholic Charities, located at 801 Buchanan Street, NE, Washington, DC 20017.

On the individual level, the prescription for achieving and maintaining health includes a lot: engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining proper hydration; eating nutritious meals that are appropriate for you, reducing stress, getting adequate sleep, and more. It is not easy. There are factors we each face as unique individuals and others that we face as a community. Similarly, nutrition is confusing and the food system is complex. Some of our families struggle with food insecurity while others do not. Some individuals want to focus on cooking skills while others want a place to purchase produce. For these reasons, the Y’s food programs adopt community-specific programming that addresses the needs and desires of our families. We believe that by doing so we can make a change in our regional food system. Our cooking classes are for those looking to increase their cooking skills and nutrition knowledge.

While DC has a Hypothermia Hotline, many of our guests do not feel safe in emergency shelter environments, and there is not support for their transition through homelessness, only maintenance of their status quo. Our Hypothermia/Transition Program is application based, and each applicant meets with his Case Manager to ensure commitment to the goals and structure of the Program. Men are approved for participation in the Program based on an assessment of their readiness to move toward the next step on their journey out of homelessness, whether that step is a job, a temporary or permanent housing situation, or stability on the road to sobriety or mental health. We open on November 1st and operate every night until March 31. The Hypothermia/Transition Program offers the men shelter for the night, a shower, a home-cooked evening meal, and time to work on their personal plan or to socialize. The Program has two exceptional characteristics: it builds a cohort and it reintroduces family interactions. Each year we provide shelter for a consistent group of 18-20 men. This is not a drop-in program, rather the same men join us each night until they find stable housing or reunite with their community. This opportunity to build a bond of trust in a predictable environment cannot be underestimated. The state of homelessness is characterized by chaos and, too often, by fear. We believe the Hypothermia/Transition Program offers a place of not just physical shelter. It also provides a mental and emotional place of safety that allows each man to focus on moving his life forward. The success of the Hypothermia/Transition Program is made possible by the consistent and loving support of the Gonzaga Mothers’ Club (GMC). Each season, the GMC and their families commit to cooking and serving the evening meal for 20 men for over 150 nights! Even more remarkable, this is not simply a drop-off service. The meals are brought to the Center by families, who then stay to serve and eat with the men. The act of breaking bread together, sharing conversation, and engaging as brothers and sisters in Christ breaks down barriers and allows everyone at the tables to see each other as individuals. This removal of the us/them divide is a tremendous gift for both our guests and our volunteers.","827272218664674","https://fathermckennacenter.org/what-we-do/hypothermia-program/","info@fathermckennacenter.org","1","none","1305774265925553,874406320909098,989050742720214","Have to be approved in an application process.

The wreckage caused by trauma can easily overwhelm and paralyze us, making us feel stuck and keeping us in crisis. DCRCC is committed to the belief that everyone can heal from trauma. We work to preserve individual agency in one’s healing. We seek to build a hub of resources to enable individuals to have more models and greater access to tools and support.

The Center has been meeting these needs since we were founded in 1983, and there is more demand than ever before. The Food Pantry is open each weekday. Families seeking food assistance check-in with volunteers and have a shopping experience allowing them to select the products they want to meet their specific family’s needs. We find this approach to be rewarding – supporting healthy meals, the dignity of choice, and reducing waste. Families may visit the Food Pantry as often as every two weeks. We provide food that supports more than 45,000 meals annually. The Food Pantry also builds community – the same families will regularly shop on the same schedule, building relationships with each other and the volunteers. We believe that reducing a family’s anxiety about putting food on the table, allows space for the grace of sharing, conversation, and care around that table. In the words of our inspiration, Fr. Horace McKenna, “You cannot speak to a person about his or her soul, when they have no food.” The Father McKenna Center Food Pantry provides an atypical pantry experience by offering both non-perishable and fresh goods.

We look at the barriers to stable employment, such as incarceration, felonies and substance abuse, and address special accommodations participants need. Our staff consists of employment specialists supported by a dedicated team of skilled volunteers. Volunteers provide one-to-one mentoring on a wide variety of job readiness topics, provide resume writing assistance, and help participants submit job applications online in the AimHire computer lab. They also help create job opportunities by reaching out to potential employers in the community.","674838894214197","https://friendshipplace.org/programs-outreach/aimhire-job-placement/","aimhire@friendshipplace.org","1","none","832122112723102,937614928620819","AimHire holds an orientation session every Wednesday at 10 am at the AimHire office, located at 5100 Wisconsin Ave NW, Suite 520 Washington, DC 20016.

The Father McKenna Center has a well-developed program of services and strategies to support our guests, balancing small goals with high expectations.

They range in age from early 20’s to over 80, and are of every race, color and creed, although the overwhelming majority are African American. Reflecting the diverse impact of homelessness, some men are well educated, while others do not have a high school diploma. We see men suffering from mental illness, struggling with addiction, and isolated from their families. Some men are coming home from incarceration, others are new to the DC area. In each man we see a unique person, beloved of God, deserving of grace, and imbued with innate dignity.

Comprehensive Assessment and Intervention Comprehensive assessment and intervention services help with a broad range of behavioral issues and stressful conditions that may affect infants through the first years of life. Parents or medical providers, may have concerns about: Aggression Anxiety Exposure to loss Feeding problems Irritability Moodiness Neglect Sleeping difficulties Violence Withdrawn behavior You child’s first meeting with specialists may last up to two hours. It will include a psychiatric assessment. At that time we observe your child during a play session and cleaning up toys afterward. After this meeting, we give general feedback and advice for parents. The underlying reasons for a child’s distress and/or behaviors can be complex. A thorough evaluation usually requires at least three visits. Afterward we may recommend or provide: Connections to school and community resources. We provide referrals for school-based services, such as DC Early Stages, Maryland Child Find, and Virginia Infants and Toddlers Connections. We also work with school administrators to help them provide services for your child. That can include letters of recommendation for school-based interventions, such as individualized educational plans (IEP), and referrals to educational advocates such as the Children’s Law Center. Daycare or preschool consultations Individual treatment strategies. This can include highly effective approaches such as parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), which is provided by PCIT-certified therapist Leandra Godoy, Ph.D.. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) can result in positive behavior changes in children with autism spectrum disorder. We also may recommend play therapy. Medication, if needed. Some children benefit from medications focused specifically on their condition. Psychiatrist Bhavin Dave, M.D., can prescribe the right medication for your child and monitor how he or she responds. Multidisciplinary care. We can connect you and your child with other providers, such as specialists in autism spectrum disorder, developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, and occupational therapy. We may also refer your child to our Sleep Center. Education for parents. Experts at Children’s National help parents understand how issues such as developmental delays and medical problems can lead to emotional or behavioral issues in young children. They also explain your child’s specific diagnosis and how it usually affects children as they grow. Parenting support groups. Our parent support group gives parents an opportunity to share and learn from each other in an atmosphere of compassion, respect, confidentiality and mutual support. Feeding Disorders Our multidisciplinary feeding disorders team was established more than 15 years ago. Since then it has helped hundreds of families. Feeding disorders in infants and young children under the age of 6 can come from a physical problem, an emotional issue or both. Assessment and care for infants and young children with these disorders can help them avoid health problems and improve their emotional well-being as they grow. Feeding disorders can include: Overeating Refusing to eat Aversions to specific foods Spitting up or vomiting in infants Difficulty sucking or swallowing in infants Gastro-esophageal reflux Children with these problems may weigh too much or too little, or be normal weight. Infants may fail to gain weight and thrive. Older children may fall behind the normal growth curve. New patients are first seen by a nurse specialist in gastroenterology. This nurse will consider your child’s medical, behavioral and nutritional issues. We also look at how well your child can control his or her lips, tongue and jaw muscles (oral-motor development). This screening will include a physical exam. After the initial report from the nurse specialist, your child will have visits with specialists in several areas of care relevant to his or her condition. We may look further into his or her oral-motor and psychiatric issues. At this time, we will observe your child from behind a one-way mirror as he or she eats and plays. Once we complete the comprehensive evaluation, the entire team meets with you to provide feedback. Our recommendations can include: Guidance for parents in feeding management Medical treatment Oral-motor therapy Referral to day treatment or inpatient care, if needed","908942274584388","https://childrensnational.org/departments/infant-and-toddler-mental-health-program-itp","","1","none","1276982655382389,1091485627676359","For a new appointment for comprehensive assessment and intervention, call 202-476-5544.

Unfortunately, that can lead to depression and other mood disorders being misdiagnosed or dismissed as a typical part of childhood, especially in teens. Mood disorders can have wide-ranging effects on children, teens and their families. The toll on their physical health, performance in school, family and social relationships and overall well-being can be devastating. Helping Children and Teens with Mood Disorders The Mood Disorders Program at Children’s National Health System is dedicated to helping children and teens with mood disorders live as happily and healthfully as possible. We personalize care for each patient and family to ensure children receive the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Features of our program include: Expert pediatric specialists. When a child or teen’s negative feelings don’t go away, our highly trained pediatric specialists have the expertise and experience to recognize mood disorders and provide the care they need. That includes pediatricians, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and others. Family-centered care. Our multi-specialty team knows that you know your child best. We value your input and work closely with your family to include you as a part of your child’s care team. This ensures he or she receives the most comprehensive and individualized care. Ongoing support and education. We strive to empower preteens and their families diagnosed with mild to moderate depression to learn about the disorder that is impacting their lives. Group sessions that include art therapy and other tools help you work together toward recovery and wellness. Finding new ways to help. Learning more about the factors that can lead to depression and other mood disorders in school-age children can improve their treatments and outcomes. Our researchers are committed to discovering new ways to identify, prevent and treat these disorders. Some of our patients participate in clinical trials. You can find out more by speaking with your child’s doctor, nurse, or other care team member. Conditions We Treat At Children’s National, we treat a wide range of mood disorders, including: Major depression. A serious condition that involves persistent sadness, hopelessness and other symptoms Bipolar disorder. A type of depression that also includes severe mood changes to extreme elation and happiness Dysthymic disorder. Depression that is less severe but more long-lasting than major depression Anxiety disorder. Excessive worry that doesn’t get better and can interfere with daily activities Children and teens with mood disorders may have: Difficult relationships with family and friends Trouble sleeping Changes in eating patterns or weight Extreme temper outbursts Low energy Poor concentration Aggressive behaviors Mood disorders can cause other symptoms as well. Parents are in a unique position to see behavior changes and problems in their children. We take your concerns seriously and listen carefully to your observations. Services We Offer We start with a thorough evaluation, which can last two sessions or more, depending on your needs. Your pediatric specialist will talk with you about your child’s symptoms, your family health history and any other psychological concerns you may have. To give us more details about your child’s condition, we may ask your family to fill out forms known as objective scales. In some cases, teachers are also asked to complete these scales. With an accurate diagnosis, we design a specific plan to provide the best care for each child. Follow-up care may involve: Individual therapy Family therapy Medication, when necessary We want you to be confident in your child’s care. To that end, we also provide second opinion evaluations and consultations.","908942274584388","https://childrensnational.org/departments/mood-disorders-program","","1","none","1276982655382389,1091485627676359","We see children and teenagers from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region and across the nation.

While families living in our affordable housing properties are no longer experiencing homelessness, they still benefit from resources that strengthen their families, increase their financial independence and ensure that they do not become homeless in the future.

Our resident services manager and coordinators work on-site at our properties to implement programming and services such as tutoring, one-on-one mentoring for education and career development, college application assistance, community gardens, HIV screenings, community events for the holidays, and special classes, like yoga and cooking, taught by qualified volunteers. Our youth enrichment services include a weekly tutoring program, character development, arts education and computer literacy. These services give children and young adults a greater chance of success in high school and college. The goal of the program is to increase the independence and stability of the families we serve.

"1131528502132736","Housing First Teams","","643509042901798","Pathways to Housing DC was founded to positively transform the lives of people experiencing chronic homelessness, who are also living with serious and persistent mental illness and challenging health conditions. For the past decade, we have successfully engaged, housed, supported, and treated over 850 adults who had been living on the streets for years. As an alternative to a system of emergency shelter/ transitional housing, our model is simple: provide housing first, and then combine that permanent housing with supportive treatment services in the areas of mental and physical health, substance abuse, education, and employment. While the model is simple, the Housing First Program is very complex and requires dedicated staff to coordinate all aspects (outreach, housing, healthcare, treatment and case management) of the program in order for the people we serve to be successful in their recoveries. Housing First means there are no conditions that have to be met before the person moves in. Housing is provided in apartments that are spread throughout the District, with each client holding their own lease. Using “scattered sites,” we are able to give each client choice in where they would like to live, helping to foster a sense of home and self-determination. Stable, supportive housing is merely the first step towards reintegrating into their community, rebuilding family relationships, reconnecting with their faith fellowships, and experiencing an improvement in overall physical health and psychological wellbeing. After receiving housing first, every client is matched with a support team (Assertive Community Treatment Team, Veterans Housing First Team and/or Permanent Supportive Housing Team) comprised of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, certified addictions counselors, employment specialists, and peer health specialists. The team works together to provide comprehensive community-based treatment and support services around the clock, with a focus on integrating both health and social well-being into the recovery plan. These vital interventions are designed to empower client choice and support successful independent living. Using this model, we have been able to maintain a housing retention rate of at least 91% with clients who have traditionally been viewed as “treatment resistant,” and “not ready for housing.” We believe that housing is a basic human right, that anyone who says they want a safe place to live is “housing ready,” and that virtually all people can be successful in housing with the proper combination of supports. Our success using the Housing First model demonstrates that the vast majority of people we connect with permanent supportive housing stay in that housing and on the path to recovery.","940988880402930","https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/housing-first/","","1","none","1305774265925553,629380122005095","We do not accept direct referrals for this program.

To do this, VIDA has a licensed nutritionist / dietitian who supervises the food services of our participants. Our nutritionist also offers nutritional and diet counseling individually and in groups. The nutritionist works in coordination with the Health Promotion Counselor to put emphasis on people with high risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. Individual and group counseling are done with the objective of helping participants establish a healthy diet, by promoting informed decisions regarding their food. It is always emphasized that a healthy diet helps prevent and manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In addition to the classes, the nutritionist also offers demonstrates of healthy cooking. Depending on the season and seasonal vegetables or fruits, healthy meals are prepared. The nutritionist regularly uses food from the Food Bank box so that we teach participants how to use those ingredients in the healthiest way possible. Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels. In addition to that, VIDA gives breakfast to 50 participants in our two centers. We do not have a subsidy to provide breakfast, but for the past year VIDA has obtained private donations of bread and cereals that allow us to deliver breakfast in the morning to 50 people. In addition, we offer free lunch to about 120 people daily. Thanks to the support of the Washington DC Department of Aging, we deliver around 120 hot lunches daily between our two centers, Monday through Friday. Additionally, Vida Senior Center is an official distributor of the city's Food Bank, with which we distribute to each participant one meal box per month.

Each year we welcome young people from colleges, schools, parishes, and other programs who not only serve as volunteers, but also live at The Father McKenna Center for a week at a time. This program is often an Alternative Spring Break or an Outreach Program for students who come to the Center on Saturday or Sunday, and stay through the following weekend. Our volunteers are not bystanders, rather they eat their meals in common with the men we serve, work in the Center, and support all aspects of our program. They sleep in the program area in the former church basement (often on pews or air mattresses they bring), take time to reflect on their experiences of service, and often have supplementary learning experiences at other organizations that support people experiencing homelessness (e.g. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless). The week of service frequently culminates in a day of advocacy as our visitors meet with their representatives or staff in the US Congress – just steps away from The Father McKenna Center. We believe the experience of immersive service plays a vital role in breaking down societal barriers, teaches about individuals as well as issues, and equips our young visitors with tools for compassionate engagement as they return to their own communities.

Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) at Mary’s Center Mary’s Center offers Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) if you are struggling with heroin-opioid abuse. We use buprenorphine (Suboxone)—a safe and clinically proven treatment—as a key part of our MAT program to help you reduce and then stop substance abuse. Patients who have used buprenorphine have reported experiencing a decrease in cravings for continued opioid use and diminished withdrawal symptoms. Here’s what you can expect if you decide to try the MAT program: You will meet with a Mary’s Center medical staff member for an assessment. Your medical provider will gather your medical history and review clinic protocols and requirements. You will be scheduled for 2 to 3 visits per week as your dose is adjusted. After that, you will have weekly to biweekly visits, eventually reducing to monthly visits. You will not be prescribed buprenorphine during your first visit or if you are taking illicit benzodiazepines or stimulants. You will need to have a plan in place to pay for medication.

District children, youth and their families (including biological, foster and adoptive families and caregivers) and children and youth who are wards of the District living in Maryland and Virginia are eligible for these specialized treatment programs. Families First services are provided by qualified designated community-based providers who receive comprehensive training and coaching in treatment models that have demonstrated positive outcomes such as restoring responsible behavior for troubled children, helping family members deal with traumatic histories, and improving family interactions. DBH is taking the following steps to implement effectively the Evidence-Based Practices identified as appropriate for the District’s population of children, youth and families: Establish the number of children in need of Evidence-Based Practices and develop a plan to meet the capacity; Monitor utilization and evaluate outcomes of the implementation of each Evidence-Based Practice through the use of a dashboard management system, and Provide ongoing training and technical support as needed to certified community based mental health providers and other community-based providers.","","https://dbh.dc.gov/service/children-youth-and-family-services","","1","none","1193736021448376,1073823868791019,1075517820799112,1131650922551092","Call the Access Helpline at 1-888-793-4357 and talk with a mental health professional who will guide you through the process.","","","","","<a href=""tel:1-888-793-4357"">1-888-793-4357</a>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vocational Rehabilitation Transition Services Vocational rehabilitation transition services link students with disabilities, while still in school, with the vocational rehabilitation program to create a continuum of services leading to long-term employment outcomes for eligible students. The benefits of (vocational rehabilitation) transition services include: the decrease in gaps in services between education and employment, the preparation and engagement of students/young adults in post-secondary training programs, and focused plans for employment that result in earlier attainment of long-term employment goals. RSA works collaboratively with the local public, public charter and non-public schools to ensure an uninterrupted plan of services for students from the secondary education environment to post-secondary education, training and employment. Services include career and/or vocational guidance and counseling and further assessments (as deemed appropriate and based on school findings) including vocational, medical, psychological, and assistive technology.

We work with families who may be experiencing difficulties with adolescent behavior problems and mental health concerns as well as the effects of abuse or neglect, trauma, and poverty.

LONG-TERM (UP TO 18 MONTHS) Our long-term program helps older homeless youth, 18-21, transition to adulthood in a loving home. Once a youth is placed in the home of a certified family, the program provides supportive services to the youth, the host family, and the youth’s biological family.

As one of the few Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) treatment providers in Washington, DC, Andromeda is uniquely positioned to provide MAT for opioid dependent persons with unmet treatment needs for substance use and co-occurring mental health disorders. Andromeda’s staff has decades of experience in working with persons with opioid dependence. Staff provides a safe space, inclusive of empathy for the consequences of addiction. Patients are seen once a month by a psychiatrist who provides them with substance abuse and mental health therapy, they participate in a group therapy session, get a urine test and then are provided a 30 day prescription of the medication. In addition, the case managers at Andromeda provide housing support, career orientation, job training opportunities, transportation subsidies, patient navigation services, language acquisition, adherence to HIV medications and/or mental health and substance use medication, nutritional classes and individual weight or diabetes management plans. They also refer patients to the array of educational health and social services that are available in the DC metro area. Andromeda patients that have been in the program have turned their lives around, working, living free of drugs and reestablishing healthy relationships. Their depression and/or other mental health illness sometimes goes in remission, but any crisis can trigger their need to go back to using opiates.

"1235579050212858","Behavioral & Mental Health - Vida Senior Centers","","879684021850075","When aging, it is sometimes inevitable that older adults have a life without much company. Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person. When the situation requires the intervention of a doctor, Vida Senior Centers refers the participant to a specialized center. For this, VIDA has been coordinating with several local organizations specialized in mental health medical treatments. In summary, the activities offered as part of our Mental Health program are as follows: • Individual counseling to handle stress situations • Group counseling on frustration management techniques • Tai-Chi exercises to learn to breathe and relax the body • Classes on Positive Thinking • Classes on Mental and Emotional Health • Referral to doctors if the need is identified","932502301190120,869647738071923","http://box2142.temp.domains/~vidasen1/behavioral-mental-health/","","1","none","1276982655382389","Call to join the center.","","","","","<a href=""tel:202 - 483 - 5800"">202 - 483 - 5800</a>","","","","965942365087326,948986432487608","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ABOUT THE VETERANS LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT The Veterans Legal Assistance Project (VLAP) provides free civil legal assistance to low-income veterans in the DC region. Often homeless and disabled, these veterans lack the most basic essentials: safe and affordable housing, healthcare, subsistence income or a job and protection from exploitation or violence. Many of their problems have legal dimensions and can be alleviated or resolved with the help of a lawyer. Launched in 2015 in response to a fragmented and inadequate network of legal assistance for destitute veterans, the VLAP provides a gateway to legal and other services for this highly vulnerable population. An NLSP Staff attorney serves as the VLAP Project Manager. The project is overseen by the Capital Area Veterans Legal Services Collaborative, a group of legal services providers and law firms in the DC area who seek to improve the accessibility, scope and delivery of effective, free civil legal services to homeless and low-income veterans.","819741028296646,826158382123021,759833313909140","http://www.nlsp.org/services/veterans","veterans.project@nlsp.org","1","none","841905613386238,1323975618617949,1238748896910244,608267763327487,594357854377389","Call or walk in during intake hours for an intake.

"1304753692724881","Notary Services","","1142792103155243","Most common law systems have what is called in the United States a notary public, a public official who notarizes legal documents and who can also administer and take oaths and affirmations, among other tasks.[2] In the United States, a signing agent, also known as a loan signing agent, is a notary public who specializes in notarizing mortgage and real estate documents. Although notary publics are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An impartial witness (the notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization. In the US (except Puerto Rico), any person – lawyer or otherwise – may be commissioned as a notary. To ""notarize"" a document or event is not a term of art, and its definition varies from place to place; but it generally means the performance by a notary of a series of possible steps, which may include the following (not an exhaustive list): Identifying the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity including passport, driving license, etc.[3] Where land titles are involved or significant rights may accrue by reference to the identity, signatures may also be verified, recorded and compared. Recording the proof of identity in the notarial register or protocol. Satisfying the notary that the person appearing is of full age and capacity to do whatever is intended. Taking an affidavit or declaration and recording that fact. Taking detailed instructions for a protest of a bill of exchange or a ship's protest and preparing it. Recording the signature of the person in the register or protocol. Taking an acknowledgment (in the United States) of execution of a document and preparing a certificate of acknowledgement. Preparing a notarial certificate (in most other jurisdictions) as to the execution or other step. Sealing or stamping and signing the document. Recording all steps in the register or protocol. Delivering the completed original to the person appearing. In some cases, retaining a copy of the document in the register or protocol. Charging the person appearing a fee for the service.","1120606829940602","https://mhcdo.org/notary-services","","","none","841905613386238","Call to set up an appointment.","","","","","<a href=""tel:(202) 396-1200"">(202) 396-1200</a>","1169394852198293","","","1255270432383739","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neighbors First Individuals follows the Housing First model, which removes all barriers to housing, including sobriety requirements, and places participants directly into their own apartments from the street or shelters using a scattered site approach. Once housed, wraparound case management support addresses the medical, psychiatric, substance use, and/or employment needs of the participant. The Housing First model welcomes participants “as they are” and favors flexibility over rules. It is person-centered, nonjudgmental, and non-coercive. The participants themselves drive the process, while case managers are there to help them achieve individual goals such as recovery, health, financial stability, education, reconnection with family, or employment.

Based on the 2015 Point in Time count of homeless guests at the Mission, among the veterans: 65% were chronically homeless, 57% were formerly institutionalized, 43% reported chronic health conditions, 26% had mental health conditions and 26% had physical disabilities. Central Union Mission serves veterans in numerous ways: Shelter. On average, 17 homeless veterans stay in the shelter each night. Some are referred to the Mission by the Veterans Administration. Through a no-cost Memorandum of Understanding with the VA, the Mission provides short-term housing for veterans while they participate in VA programs for homeless veterans. Through this partnership, the Mission provided 1,195 nights of shelter to 48 veterans over the past year. This is in addition to over 5,000 nights of shelter provided to veterans not referred by the VA. Food. Through its food pantry, the Mission serves on average 35 veterans per month, providing each of them and their families with enough groceries for about 96 meals each month. The Mission also serves 3 meals per day to homeless guests as well as other hungry people who walk in its doors, amounting to over 50 meals per day for veterans. Altogether, the Mission provides over 58,000 meals to veterans per year. Workforce Development Programs. Approximately 2 veterans participate each year in the Mission’s Work Therapy Program and Ready2Succeed programs, that provide work readiness training, employs veterans in-house in the Mission’s homeless shelter and food pantry and in Mission-held contracts and entrepreneurial ventures. The Mission employs each participant for 6 to 24 months and helps them secure unsubsidized jobs and housing. Supportive Social Services and Education. Veterans benefit from all levels of service of the Mission, including social services; classes in GED preparation, Basic Adult Education, and job search skills; transitional housing for working veterans who cannot afford their own rent; and rehabilitation from drugs, alcohol and other addictions.","1139106965939659","https://www.missiondc.org/what-we-do/mens-ministry/workforce/","","1","none","1276982655382389,1305774265925553,1211420433536032,893915418546777,832122112723102,594357854377389,629380122005095,989050742720214","Call for more information.

Many of these individuals stay on the streets despite the weather or their needs. GMC staff does street outreach several times a week, usually with our medical team, to offer medical and psychiatric care, build trusting relationships, and prevent injury or death from exposure. Hypothermia Outreach Team (HOT) In January 2013, GMC partnered with Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice to create a volunteer hypothermia outreach team (HOT). These volunteers, made up of students, faculty, and staff, do street outreach on behalf of GMC on the coldest nights to check on those unwilling to go to shelters. They let people know about what warming sites are available, distribute cold-weather accessories, and check for signs and symptoms of hypothermia. The Hypothermia Outreach Team was featured on NPR and Georgetown University put together this informational video. Take a few minutes to listen, watch and learn more about how the team works and how they interact with people on the street. Saving Lives Through Street Outreach Often, we encounter the same individuals week after week during our street outreach rounds. We always stop to say hello and ask if they need anything from us, and often the most service-resistant individuals will always dismiss us. “No, I’m fine. I don’t need anything.” Still, we persist week after week and become a familiar face and trusted source for help. Mickey was a man we encountered every week sitting outside of the same store in Georgetown. We’d always say hello and ask if he needed anything, but he’d always say no, and we’d move on. One day when we were walking with Dr. Crosland, our general practitioner, Mickey switched his answer from no to yes. He wanted us to check his blood pressure, which we found out was alarmingly high. Mickey let us call an ambulance for him, and we later found out that he was suffering from a heart attack. Mickey stayed in the hospital for several days before being discharged. This is why we continue to do street outreach week after week and talk to people, even if they always tell us they don’t need help. One day, they might, and we want to be there for them when they do.","584945568119538","https://georgetownministrycenter.org/programs/street-outreach/","info@gmcgt.org","1","none","1305774265925553,893915418546777,629380122005095,1091485627676359","Call for more information.

"1350703837531701","Newborn Screening","","1329764475795847","DOH administers two newborn screening programs to ensure that all infants are screened. Newborn screening is quick and easy - requiring only a hearing test and blood tests - and is performed soon after a baby’s birth, and in most cases, while the baby is still in the hospital. We provide the following screening programs: - Newborn Metabolic Screening Program is designed to ensure that all infants born in the District of Columbia are screened for genetic and metabolic disorders at birth. Newborns with inconclusive or positive screening results will get genetic counseling and education, clinical evaluation and management, diagnostic (lab) testing, referrals, and follow-up services. - Newborn Hearing Screening Program is designed to ensure that all infants born in the District of Columbia get a newborn hearing screening before they are discharged from the hospital. Infants that do not pass the initial and repeat screenings will be evaluated and linked to hospitals, primary health care providers, public health workers and others for appropriate treatment. The Program also provides culturally-competent support to families throughout the screening, diagnostic, and intervention stages. All babies should be screened at birth for metabolic and hearing problems so that they can get the services they need as early as possible. Even infants that appear perfectly healthy at birth can have a metabolic or hearing disorder. Metabolic disorders rare, but serious, conditions that can lead to severe health and developmental problems or even death if not identified and treated early. However, if caught early and given the right services, most infants with hearing and metabolic disorders can grow up healthy. If your child has an abnormal screen or did not receive a hearing or metabolic screening before leaving the hospital, or if you would like more information, call 1-800-MOM-BABY or 1-800-666-2229.","1333682431246552","https://dchealth.dc.gov/service/newborn-screening","","2","none","976566727118378,627746874732291,879394671891223,964978986111653,893915418546777,1294707318379665,1212005456553071,713360107412317,1300476128041301,1246679254354805,615363042499687,1118011435663674,1139839930624727,1238748896910244","","","","","","<a href=""tel:800-666-2229"">800-666-2229</a>&nbsp;(Voice)","1338861885601972,1338861885601973,1338861885601974,1338861885601975,1338861885601976,1338861885601977,1338861885601978,1338861885601981","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
