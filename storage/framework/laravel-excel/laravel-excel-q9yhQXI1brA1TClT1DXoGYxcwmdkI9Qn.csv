189,785453766981777,,"The Day Center",,"At the Day Center, we promote mental, physical, spiritual and emotional healing through a holistic, integrated and evidence-based treatment approach. We provide trauma interventions, mindfulness and art therapy to help improve outcomes in the clients we serve. Patients can achieve a lasting recovery with support from peers and a highly trained staff.

Intensive Outpatient & Partial Hospitalization Program
Both the IOP & PHP programs offer a structured daily schedule consisting of evidence-based group therapy and a variety of hands-on art therapy, recreation and expressive activities. We help adults experiencing mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, bipolar diagnoses, or anxiety return to a healthy daily routine that incorporates self-care, social interaction, and mindfulness.

The Partial Hospitalization Program provides an intense, structured treatment setting for individuals who would benefit from daily therapeutic interventions or who would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care.

Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP)
Intensive Outpatient clients come to the PIW Day Center from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm three days a week for psychiatric services and group therapy sessions. While multiple groups are offered licensed clinicians work with each IOP client to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the client’s strengths, diagnosis and identified opportunities for growth and skill building.

During treatment, patients generally attend 3 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the client’s treatment plan.

Partial Hospitalization Treatment (PHP)
The Partial Hospitalization Program runs five days per week, five hours each day 9:00am to 2:00pm, plus a 30 minute lunch break.  Each day:

Begins with a community meeting group to review the daily schedule
Welcomes any new individuals
Reviews progress on treatment goals
Addresses any concerns or challenges
During treatment, patients generally attend 4 groups a day and receive other individualized care provided by licensed clinicians and a psychiatrist in accordance with the patient’s treatment plan.

Trauma Recovery & Empowerment Model
The Day Center at PIW utilizes an evidence based approach called The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). TREM is a fully manualized, group-based intervention designed to facilitate trauma recovery among women with histories of exposure to sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Drawing on cognitive restructuring, psychoeducational, and skills-training techniques, the intervention emphasizes the development of coping skills and social support. It addresses both short-term and long-term consequences of violent victimization and neglect, including mental health symptoms, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse.

Mindfulness
The Day Center at PIW utilizes the practice of Mindfulness to support clients in their healing. Mindfulness is an integrative, mind-body based approach that helps people to manage their thoughts, feelings and mental health. It has become widely used in a range of contexts to support emotional health and awareness.

Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment, using techniques like meditation, breathing, and yoga. Training helps people to become more aware of their thoughts, feelings and body sensations so that instead of being overwhelmed by them, they are better able to manage them. Practicing mindfulness can give more insight into emotions, boost attention and concentration as well as improve relationships.",https://psychinstitute.com/treatment-services/adults/the-day-center/,,active,,"PIW’s Day Center Program has evidence-based treatment and skill enhancement to improve a person’s ability to function in daily life.

Family Engagement
Community Support Workers will work with the families to assist in making the transition. MBI staff use Family Group Conferencing (FGC) when working with families. Young people need the sense of community, identity and stability that only the family, in its various forms, can provide. Families are more likely than professionals to find solutions, which actively involve other family members, thus keeping the child within the care of the family, rather than transferring care of the child to the state. The key features of the FGC model are preparation, information giving, and private family time, agreeing on the plan, and monitoring and review.",http://www.mbihs.com/what-we-offer/returning-citizens-program,,active,,"Call to join the program.",,,,

The Project was named for its founding Director, Barbara McDowell, after her untimely death.

The Project not only litigates appeals on behalf of Legal Aid clients but also files “friend of the court” briefs on cases involving matters of importance to people living in poverty. Beyond litigation, the Project provides appellate instruction, consultation, and advice to the larger D.C. legal services community. Although most of the Project’s work involves cases before the District’s highest court – the District of Columbia Court of Appeals – the Project also gets involved in administrative appeals and cases before the District of Columbia Superior Court and the federal courts.

Learn more about Barbara McDowell, the renowned appellate litigator and U.S. Supreme Court advocate who served as the project’s first director and after whom our appellate advocacy project is named.

After Barbara’s untimely death, Legal Aid created the Barbara McDowell Endowment Fund for Appellate Litigation with funds donated both from Barbara’s estate and from the generous donations of her husband, Jerry Hartman. The Fund was created “to honor the immeasurable contributions that Barbara made to Legal Aid and the legal needs of persons living in poverty in the District of Columbia.” Jerry has continued to donate generously in Barbara’s honor to the Fund to sustain the ongoing, important work of The Barbara McDowell Appellate Advocacy Project.

The stages of treatment reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility.

It is now widely understood that a number of illnesses and injuries can be caused by lead exposure. The District Government recognizes this and in response Mayor Bowser signed legislation for two new lead water service line replacement programs that assist homes affected by this environmental hazard:

1. Full Lead Pipe Replacement
In October, 2019, the District transferred $1 million to DC Water to cover the complete cost of the lead water service pipe replacement on private property when DC Water replaces the portion of lead pipe in public space during a Capital Improvement Project (i.e., water main replacement).
NOTE: Customers do not need to apply to this program and DC Water will contact you if there are any planned projects in your neighborhood.

If both the public and private portions of the service line are lead and no capital improvement is scheduled for two years, property owners can enroll in the Voluntary Lead Service Pipe Replacement Program. Applications will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis and this program is subject to the availability of funding.

2. Private-side Partial Lead Pipe Replacements

In Fiscal Year 2020 (October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020), the District has allocated $1.8 million dollars to provide assistance for the replacement of lead pipes on private property if the pipe in the public space is not lead. The Lead Pipe Replacement Assistance Program (LPRAP) uses District funds to assist with eligible property owner’s lead pipe replacement. Each property owner can receive 50% of their costs covered (up to $2,500), regardless of income. Some residents will qualify for 80% or 100% assistance depending on household size and income.

As part of the Health Promotion program, our counselors routinely check the participants who register daily: their pressure is measured; their blood sugar levels are monitored; and their vital signs are supervised. Due to the high preparation of our counselors, when it is detected that the participant requires a medical appointment, the participants are referred to an appointment with their primary doctor or the needed specialist, if the case requires so. VIDA works with 7 hospitals in the city to which our counselors refer the participants when necessary. If the participant needs it, our social service counselor helps the participant to make the medical appointment. Sometimes the language barriers require this type of support. We also have a medication monitoring program to teach participants to know the benefits and side effects of the medications they take, so that they can understand the impact of their medications and identify if there is a problem. As part of the “Medication Monitoring Program”, a personalized follow-up of each person who enrolls in the program is carried out and a medication organizer pill is provided free of charge, so that they learn to take their medications on time and also learn to realize when they forget to take their pills.

What is a Representative Payee?
A Representative Payee is an individual or an organization designated to receive disability benefits on a client’s behalf.

The Representative Payee must keep records of how the client’s money is spent. This information is reported regularly to the Social Security Administration or to the Office of Personnel Management.

How does the Representative Payee Program work?
Clients enrolled in Bread for the City’s Representative Payee Program work with their mental health service providers and Bread for the City staff to make sure that all of their financial needs are met.

The client’s case manager at the DC Department of Behavioral Health or a DBH affiliated Core Service Agency makes an initial referral to Bread for the City for payee services. The client is enrolled at a start-up meeting with the case manager and a Representative Payee Program staff member during which we discuss how the services work.

After enrollment, Bread for the City applies to the Social Security Administration or Office of Personnel Management to become the client’s Representative Payee. The client and his or her mental health case manager meet regularly to set and review the client’s monthly budget and discuss any emergency spending requests. Bread for the City relies on the case manager to be in regular contact with the client and keep Bread for the City informed about changes in the client’s needs that might affect the budget or benefits.

Contacting the Representative Payee Program
The RPP can be reached by phone at 202.386.7016 – the Program Assistant is able to answer many questions about the status of client accounts and requests. The program assigns a RPP Coordinator to work with the clients and staff based on the DBH provider where the client is enrolled.",https://breadforthecity.org/social-services/,,active,,"Call the Department Phone Line",,,,

P2I is an intensive five-year commitment for families living below the poverty line, and we will launch the initial cohort in the fall of 2018.

While our services continue to be in great demand and produce significant change for individuals and families, we, like many organizations across the country, yearn for more progress in supporting families’ efforts to rise out of poverty. We believe this program will contribute significantly to that end.

406,1121342754860910,,"Gender Development Program",,"A Multidisciplinary Program for Gender-Diverse Youth and Their Families 
Some young people feel, sense or know they are a gender different than the one they were assumed at birth. They may live and dress in ways typical of another gender (gender non-conformity), and some may experience the need to live and be affirmed as this gender in some or all settings. This can be an urgent need, or for others, there may be experimentation and exploration. There are also some young people who show gender non-conformity in their everyday behaviors, but may not yet have the self-advocacy skills to discuss their gender identity and their gender-related needs. Each child's gender journey is unique.

The gender development of a child may be confusing to parents and families, providers, and sometimes young people themselves. Parents may wonder:

How can my child's gender-related needs best be supported?
How do we navigate our child's gender diversity in everyday life (e.g., with family, in school, when moving into adulthood, etc.)?
Is my child transgender?
Will my child's gender and gender-related needs change over time?
The needs of gender-diverse youth are often complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and ongoing care supports over time.

About Us
The Gender Development Program at Children's National has been supporting the gender needs of youth and their families for the past 20 years. As one of the earliest founded youth gender programs, we are a multidisciplinary team of specialists who work in the assessment and broad care needs of youth on the gender spectrum and their families. We also conduct cutting-edge research to move forward our understanding of youth gender development and ways to best support gender-diverse and transgender youth. Research findings inform all of our clinical care.

We work with gender exploring, gender non-conforming, gender dysphoric, gender non-binary, transgender and gender-questioning young people, and we see children and adolescents of all ages. We also work with youth who have genetic and other conditions in which gender variation is common.

We offer:

Personalized evaluations and tailored care: This includes evaluation of your child's gender development and needs in the real world. Throughout care with us, your child will receive supports tailored to their unique needs, in coordination with an existing community of professionals your child already sees to ensure continuity and consistency of care.
Comprehensive services and collaboration with multiple specialties: From initial and ongoing evaluation and support to specialists in medical treatments such as Veronica Gomez-Lobo, M.D., a pediatric gynecologist who provides medical interventions such as puberty suppression or hormone therapy, the program offers a full spectrum of care options based on the needs of each young person.
Unique programs for diverse needs:
Children and teens who have both autism spectrum characteristics (or related conditions) and gender dysphoria have access to a support program designed specifically for them: the Gender and Autism Program led by John Strang, Psy.D. Many providers refer patients to our program to access these services, which may not be offered elsewhere.
The Gender Development Program works closely with the Youth Pride Clinic, which offers primary and specialty care services to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer) patients.
Evaluation and Ongoing Supports
Your child’s care will start with an initial evaluation by our team. During this two to three-hour visit, you will meet the team together with your child and also separately. The goals of these visits vary from family to family and may include:

Understanding the various aspects of your child’s gender development
Screening for any mental health concerns/risks
Support for parenting a gender diverse child
Support for families navigating issues related to siblings, friends, school, etc.
We may ask you and your child to return for periodic follow-up visits. These visits can help us make a more extended evaluation. Your team also may suggest treatments or supportive services through Children’s National or in the community such as:

Individual supports for youth and/or parents
Family-specific supports
School supports/interventions

In comparison to curative care, which is meant to cure a disease, palliative care is meant to make the patient more comfortable. The definition of palliative care is ""to make a disease or its symptoms less severe or unpleasant without removing the cause."" Palliative care will lessen or ""palliate"" the symptoms and improve your quality of life.

At VITAS, palliative care begins with a plan uniquely tailored by an interdisciplinary team to meet the needs of the patient. The team can work with newly diagnosed patients and those struggling with the effects or after-effects of curative therapies. Some members of the palliative team may be board certified in hospice and palliative medicine; others range from chaplains to social workers.

A palliative consult with the patient provides timely and specific information that helps the patient and family understand what palliative medicine brings to the table and helps physicians and the rest of the interdisciplinary team provide the most appropriate care.

If the patient’s symptoms escalate and can no longer be managed by routine palliative care, VITAS is available 24/7 to transition the patient to a higher level of care with round-the-clock support from a crisis nurse until symptoms are back under control. If symptoms are especially aggressive, VITAS can transfer the patient to an inpatient hospice unit for intensive symptom management until they’re ready to return home.

Each year we provide shelter for a consistent group of 18-20 men. This is not a drop-in program, rather the same men join us each night until they find stable housing or reunite with their community. This opportunity to build a bond of trust in a predictable environment cannot be underestimated. The state of homelessness is characterized by chaos and, too often, by fear. We believe the Hypothermia/Transition Program offers a place of not just physical shelter. It also provides a mental and emotional place of safety that allows each man to focus on moving his life forward.

The success of the Hypothermia/Transition Program is made possible by the consistent and loving support of the Gonzaga Mothers’ Club (GMC). Each season, the GMC and their families commit to cooking and serving the evening meal for 20 men for over 150 nights! Even more remarkable, this is not simply a drop-off service. The meals are brought to the Center by families, who then stay to serve and eat with the men. The act of breaking bread together, sharing conversation, and engaging as brothers and sisters in Christ breaks down barriers and allows everyone at the tables to see each other as individuals. This removal of the us/them divide is a tremendous gift for both our guests and our volunteers.",https://fathermckennacenter.org/what-we-do/hypothermia-program/,info@fathermckennacenter.org,active,,"Have to be approved in an application process.

Imagining healing is one of the most challenging tasks asked of a survivor. The word itself conjures the visual of a spinning turntable as one navigates feelings of hopelessness, shame, anger, fear, doubt and anxiety. The wreckage caused by trauma can easily overwhelm and paralyze us, making us feel stuck and keeping us in crisis.

DCRCC is committed to the belief that everyone can heal from trauma. We work to preserve individual agency in one’s healing. We seek to build a hub of resources to enable individuals to have more models and greater access to tools and support. The premise of ‘There is No Straight Path’ is to reframe healing as gathering tools and developing skills that begin to restore a sense of power and control.

The Food Pantry is open each weekday.

Men struggling with homelessness face a range of obstacles. The Father McKenna Center has a well-developed program of services and strategies to support our guests, balancing small goals with high expectations. The ultimate goal of our work is to help each man reach his full potential. Our approach is to meet each person where he is and support him as he works toward a life of stability, productivity, meaning, and hope.

In any week we have over 250 unique guests (in the course of a year more than 1,800 different men spend time at the Center). They range in age from early 20’s to over 80, and are of every race, color and creed, although the overwhelming majority are African American.

Reflecting the diverse impact of homelessness, some men are well educated, while others do not have a high school diploma. We see men suffering from mental illness, struggling with addiction, and isolated from their families. Some men are coming home from incarceration, others are new to the DC area. In each man we see a unique person, beloved of God, deserving of grace, and imbued with innate dignity.

We provide:
Structured case management, including counseling, an accountability program, and referrals for mental and physical health assessments.

678,1121342754860910,,"Infant and Toddler Mental Health Program (ITP)",,"Most children can be gloomy or irritable at times. But for some children and even infants, difficulties in personality or mood can be more serious. These problems are sometimes related to a medical condition or to a developmental delay. They also may result from a traumatic event.

Whatever the cause, we understand how stressful and confusing it can be when your young child is having trouble. We are here to help relieve these problems in children up to age 5, and prevent them from worsening as children grow up.

Why Choose Us
At the Infant and Toddler Mental Health Program (ITP) at Children’s National Health System, we diagnose personality and mood conditions early and design treatments specifically for your child. Features of our program include:

Unique, specialized psychiatric services for young children. We are one of only a few providers in the region specializing in psychiatric treatment for preschool-age children and in specialized therapies for this age group such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a best practice therapeutic approach for young children with behavioral difficulties and their parents. Our feeding disorders clinic is one of only a few of its kind in the U.S. that specializes in treating infants and toddlers.
Compassionate, personalized care for each patient and family. Our Infant and Toddler Mental Health specialists consider each child’s individual situation and always treat you and your family as part of the team. We take the time to help you understand your child’s diagnosis and treatment and to answer any questions you may have. Our care supports your child’s emerging abilities and helps him or her grow into a healthy and happy child.
Internationally known for our results. The defining work on feeding disorders in young children was written by our director, Irene Chatoor, M.D.. Children who need specialized expertise and child-focused care are referred to us from the Washington, D.C., area, across the nation and around the world.
Close collaboration with skilled specialists. Our team works closely with a variety of specialists who add perspective to your child’s care. They can include occupational therapists and speech-language therapists, as well as experts from fields such as developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, autism spectrum disorder and sleep disorders.
Specialized Care
Identifying mental health issues in children is complex. Children’s National offers two care paths that draw on multiple resources for your child.

Comprehensive Assessment and Intervention
Comprehensive assessment and intervention services help with a broad range of behavioral issues and stressful conditions that may affect infants through the first years of life. Parents or medical providers, may have concerns about:

Aggression
Anxiety
Exposure to loss
Feeding problems
Irritability
Moodiness
Neglect
Sleeping difficulties
Violence
Withdrawn behavior
You child’s first meeting with specialists may last up to two hours. It will include a psychiatric assessment. At that time we observe your child during a play session and cleaning up toys afterward. After this meeting, we give general feedback and advice for parents.

The underlying reasons for a child’s distress and/or behaviors can be complex.

A thorough evaluation usually requires at least three visits. Afterward we may recommend or provide:

Connections to school and community resources. We provide referrals for school-based services, such as DC Early Stages, Maryland Child Find, and Virginia Infants and Toddlers Connections. We also work with school administrators to help them provide services for your child. That can include letters of recommendation for school-based interventions, such as individualized educational plans (IEP), and referrals to educational advocates such as the Children’s Law Center.
Daycare or preschool consultations
Individual treatment strategies. This can include highly effective approaches such as parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), which is provided by PCIT-certified therapist Leandra Godoy, Ph.D.. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) can result in positive behavior changes in children with autism spectrum disorder. We also may recommend play therapy.
Medication, if needed. Some children benefit from medications focused specifically on their condition. Psychiatrist Bhavin Dave, M.D., can prescribe the right medication for your child and monitor how he or she responds.
Multidisciplinary care. We can connect you and your child with other providers, such as specialists in autism spectrum disorder, developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, and occupational therapy. We may also refer your child to our Sleep Center.
Education for parents. Experts at Children’s National help parents understand how issues such as developmental delays and medical problems can lead to emotional or behavioral issues in young children. They also explain your child’s specific diagnosis and how it usually affects children as they grow.
Parenting support groups. Our parent support group gives parents an opportunity to share and learn from each other in an atmosphere of compassion, respect, confidentiality and mutual support.
Feeding Disorders
Our multidisciplinary feeding disorders team was established more than 15 years ago. Since then it has helped hundreds of families.

Feeding disorders in infants and young children under the age of 6 can come from a physical problem, an emotional issue or both. Assessment and care for infants and young children with these disorders can help them avoid health problems and improve their emotional well-being as they grow. Feeding disorders can include:
Overeating
Refusing to eat
Aversions to specific foods
Spitting up or vomiting in infants
Difficulty sucking or swallowing in infants
Gastro-esophageal reflux
Children with these problems may weigh too much or too little, or be normal weight. Infants may fail to gain weight and thrive. Older children may fall behind the normal growth curve.

New patients are first seen by a nurse specialist in gastroenterology. This nurse will consider your child’s medical, behavioral and nutritional issues. We also look at how well your child can control his or her lips, tongue and jaw muscles (oral-motor development). This screening will include a physical exam.

After the initial report from the nurse specialist, your child will have visits with specialists in several areas of care relevant to his or her condition. We may look further into his or her oral-motor and psychiatric issues. At this time, we will observe your child from behind a one-way mirror as he or she eats and plays.

Once we complete the comprehensive evaluation, the entire team meets with you to provide feedback. Our recommendations can include:

Guidance for parents in feeding management
Medical treatment
Oral-motor therapy

A notario, notario público, or immigration consultant in the U.S. is not an attorney nor an accredited representative of the Department of Justice in the U.S., and consequently, is not licensed to provide paid immigration legal advice or legal services. Unscrupulous notarios or consultants routinely prey on immigrants who, because of linguistic, cultural, and financial obstacles, believe a notario or consultant can assist them with their legal issues. The fraudulent work of notarios or immigration consultants can have life-devastating consequences on its victims, including financial ruin, damage to a legal case, deportation, and permanent family separation.

Mood disorders can have wide-ranging effects on children, teens and their families. The toll on their physical health, performance in school, family and social relationships and overall well-being can be devastating.

Helping Children and Teens with Mood Disorders
The Mood Disorders Program at Children’s National Health System is dedicated to helping children and teens with mood disorders live as happily and healthfully as possible. We personalize care for each patient and family to ensure children receive the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes.

Features of our program include:

Expert pediatric specialists. When a child or teen’s negative feelings don’t go away, our highly trained pediatric specialists have the expertise and experience to recognize mood disorders and provide the care they need. That includes pediatricians, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and others.
Family-centered care. Our multi-specialty team knows that you know your child best. We value your input and work closely with your family to include you as a part of your child’s care team. This ensures he or she receives the most comprehensive and individualized care.
Ongoing support and education. We strive to empower preteens and their families diagnosed with mild to moderate depression to learn about the disorder that is impacting their lives. Group sessions that include art therapy and other tools help you work together toward recovery and wellness.
Finding new ways to help. Learning more about the factors that can lead to depression and other mood disorders in school-age children can improve their treatments and outcomes. Our researchers are committed to discovering new ways to identify, prevent and treat these disorders. Some of our patients participate in clinical trials. You can find out more by speaking with your child’s doctor, nurse, or other care team member.
Conditions We Treat
At Children’s National, we treat a wide range of mood disorders, including:

Major depression. A serious condition that involves persistent sadness, hopelessness and other symptoms
Bipolar disorder. A type of depression that also includes severe mood changes to extreme elation and happiness
Dysthymic disorder. Depression that is less severe but more long-lasting than major depression
Anxiety disorder. Excessive worry that doesn’t get better and can interfere with daily activities
Children and teens with mood disorders may have:

Difficult relationships with family and friends
Trouble sleeping
Changes in eating patterns or weight
Extreme temper outbursts
Low energy
Poor concentration
Aggressive behaviors
Mood disorders can cause other symptoms as well. Parents are in a unique position to see behavior changes and problems in their children. We take your concerns seriously and listen carefully to your observations.

Services We Offer
We start with a thorough evaluation, which can last two sessions or more, depending on your needs. Your pediatric specialist will talk with you about your child’s symptoms, your family health history and any other psychological concerns you may have. To give us more details about your child’s condition, we may ask your family to fill out forms known as objective scales. In some cases, teachers are also asked to complete these scales.

With an accurate diagnosis, we design a specific plan to provide the best care for each child. Follow-up care may involve:

Individual therapy
Family therapy
Medication, when necessary
We want you to be confident in your child’s care. To that end, we also provide second opinion evaluations and consultations.",https://childrensnational.org/departments/mood-disorders-program,,active,,"We see children and teenagers from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region and across the nation.

798,643509042901798,,"Housing First Teams",,"Pathways to Housing DC was founded to positively transform the lives of people experiencing chronic homelessness, who are also living with serious and persistent mental illness and challenging health conditions. For the past decade, we have successfully engaged, housed, supported, and treated over 850 adults who had been living on the streets for years. As an alternative to a system of emergency shelter/ transitional housing, our model is simple: provide housing first, and then combine that permanent housing with supportive treatment services in the areas of mental and physical health, substance abuse, education, and employment.

While the model is simple, the Housing First Program is very complex and requires dedicated staff to coordinate all aspects (outreach, housing, healthcare, treatment and case management) of the program in order for the people we serve to be successful in their recoveries. Housing First means there are no conditions that have to be met before the person moves in. Housing is provided in apartments that are spread throughout the District, with each client holding their own lease. Using “scattered sites,” we are able to give each client choice in where they would like to live, helping to foster a sense of home and self-determination. Stable, supportive housing is merely the first step towards reintegrating into their community, rebuilding family relationships, reconnecting with their faith fellowships, and experiencing an improvement in overall physical health and psychological wellbeing.

After receiving housing first, every client is matched with a support team (Assertive Community Treatment Team, Veterans Housing First Team and/or Permanent Supportive Housing Team) comprised of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, certified addictions counselors, employment specialists, and peer health specialists. The team works together to provide comprehensive community-based treatment and support services around the clock, with a focus on integrating both health and social well-being into the recovery plan. These vital interventions are designed to empower client choice and support successful independent living. Using this model, we have been able to maintain a housing retention rate of at least 91% with clients who have traditionally been viewed as “treatment resistant,” and “not ready for housing.” We believe that housing is a basic human right, that anyone who says they want a safe place to live is “housing ready,” and that virtually all people can be successful in housing with the proper combination of supports. Our success using the Housing First model demonstrates that the vast majority of people we connect with permanent supportive housing stay in that housing and on the path to recovery.",https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/housing-first/,,active,,"We do not accept direct referrals for this program.

Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels.

Each year we welcome young people from colleges, schools, parishes, and other programs who not only serve as volunteers, but also live at The Father McKenna Center for a week at a time. This program is often an Alternative Spring Break or an Outreach Program for students who come to the Center on Saturday or Sunday, and stay through the following weekend.

Our volunteers are not bystanders, rather they eat their meals in common with the men we serve, work in the Center, and support all aspects of our program. They sleep in the program area in the former church basement (often on pews or air mattresses they bring), take time to reflect on their experiences of service, and often have supplementary learning experiences at other organizations that support people experiencing homelessness (e.g. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless). The week of service frequently culminates in a day of advocacy as our visitors meet with their representatives or staff in the US Congress – just steps away from The Father McKenna Center.

We believe the experience of immersive service plays a vital role in breaking down societal barriers, teaches about individuals as well as issues, and equips our young visitors with tools for compassionate engagement as they return to their own communities.

As one of our visitors from The University of Notre Dame observed, “When I arrived, the homeless were a demographic. Now, they are people.

Vocational Rehabilitation Transition Services
Vocational rehabilitation transition services link students with disabilities, while still in school, with the vocational rehabilitation program to create a continuum of services leading to long-term employment outcomes for eligible students. The benefits of (vocational rehabilitation) transition services include:

the decrease in gaps in services between education and employment,
the preparation and engagement of students/young adults in post-secondary training programs, and
focused plans for employment that result in earlier attainment of long-term employment goals.
RSA works collaboratively with the local public, public charter and non-public schools to ensure an uninterrupted plan of services for students from the secondary education environment to post-secondary education, training and employment.

Services include career and/or vocational guidance and counseling and further assessments (as deemed appropriate and based on school findings) including vocational, medical, psychological, and assistive technology.

983,879684021850075,,"Behavioral & Mental Health - Vida Senior Centers",,"When aging, it is sometimes inevitable that older adults have a life without much company. Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person. When the situation requires the intervention of a doctor, Vida Senior Centers refers the participant to a specialized center. For this, VIDA has been coordinating with several local organizations specialized in mental health medical treatments. In summary, the activities offered as part of our Mental Health program are as follows:

• Individual counseling to handle stress situations
• Group counseling on frustration management techniques
• Tai-Chi exercises to learn to breathe and relax the body

ABOUT THE VETERANS LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT

The Veterans Legal Assistance Project (VLAP) provides free civil legal assistance to low-income veterans in the DC region. Often homeless and disabled, these veterans lack the most basic essentials: safe and affordable housing, healthcare, subsistence income or a job and protection from exploitation or violence. Many of their problems have legal dimensions and can be alleviated or resolved with the help of a lawyer.

Launched in 2015 in response to a fragmented and inadequate network of legal assistance for destitute veterans, the VLAP provides a gateway to legal and other services for this highly vulnerable population. An NLSP Staff attorney serves as the VLAP Project Manager. The project is overseen by the Capital Area Veterans Legal Services Collaborative, a group of legal services providers and law firms in the DC area who seek to improve the accessibility, scope and delivery of effective, free civil legal services to homeless and low-income veterans.",http://www.nlsp.org/services/veterans," veterans.project@nlsp.org",active,,"Call or walk in during intake hours for an intake.

Although notary publics are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An impartial witness (the notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization. In the US (except Puerto Rico), any person – lawyer or otherwise – may be commissioned as a notary.





To ""notarize"" a document or event is not a term of art, and its definition varies from place to place; but it generally means the performance by a notary of a series of possible steps, which may include the following (not an exhaustive list):



Identifying the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity including passport, driving license, etc.[3]

Where land titles are involved or significant rights may accrue by reference to the identity, signatures may also be verified, recorded and compared.

Recording the proof of identity in the notarial register or protocol.

Satisfying the notary that the person appearing is of full age and capacity to do whatever is intended.

Taking an affidavit or declaration and recording that fact.

Taking detailed instructions for a protest of a bill of exchange or a ship's protest and preparing it.

Recording the signature of the person in the register or protocol.

Taking an acknowledgment (in the United States) of execution of a document and preparing a certificate of acknowledgement.

Preparing a notarial certificate (in most other jurisdictions) as to the execution or other step.

The Housing First model welcomes participants “as they are” and favors flexibility over rules. It is person-centered, nonjudgmental, and non-coercive. The participants themselves drive the process, while case managers are there to help them achieve individual goals such as recovery, health, financial stability, education, reconnection with family, or employment.

 Central Union Mission serves veterans in numerous ways:

Shelter.  On average, 17 homeless veterans stay in the shelter each night.  Some are referred to the Mission by the Veterans Administration.  Through a no-cost Memorandum of Understanding with the VA, the Mission provides short-term housing for veterans while they participate in VA programs for homeless veterans.  Through this partnership, the Mission provided 1,195 nights of shelter to 48 veterans over the past year.  This is in addition to over 5,000 nights of shelter provided to veterans not referred by the VA.

 Food.  Through its food pantry, the Mission serves on average 35 veterans per month, providing each of them and their families with enough groceries for about 96 meals each month.  The Mission also serves 3 meals per day to homeless guests as well as other hungry people who walk in its doors, amounting to over 50 meals per day for veterans.  Altogether, the Mission provides over 58,000 meals to veterans per year.

Workforce Development Programs.  Approximately 2 veterans participate each year in the Mission’s Work Therapy Program and Ready2Succeed programs, that provide work readiness training, employs veterans in-house in the Mission’s homeless shelter and food pantry and in Mission-held contracts and entrepreneurial ventures.  The Mission employs each participant for 6 to 24 months and helps them secure unsubsidized jobs and housing.

Many of these individuals stay on the streets despite the weather or their needs. GMC staff does street outreach several times a week, usually with our medical team, to offer medical and psychiatric care, build trusting relationships, and prevent injury or death from exposure.

Hypothermia Outreach Team (HOT)

In January 2013, GMC partnered with Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice to create a volunteer hypothermia outreach team (HOT). These volunteers, made up of students, faculty, and staff, do street outreach on behalf of GMC on the coldest nights to check on those unwilling to go to shelters. They let people know about what warming sites are available, distribute cold-weather accessories, and check for signs and symptoms of hypothermia.

The Hypothermia Outreach Team was featured on NPR and Georgetown University put together this informational video. Take a few minutes to listen, watch and learn more about how the team works and how they interact with people on the street.

Saving Lives Through Street Outreach

Often, we encounter the same individuals week after week during our street outreach rounds. We always stop to say hello and ask if they need anything from us, and often the most service-resistant individuals will always dismiss us. “No, I’m fine. I don’t need anything.” Still, we persist week after week and become a familiar face and trusted source for help.

Mickey was a man we encountered every week sitting outside of the same store in Georgetown. We’d always say hello and ask if he needed anything, but he’d always say no, and we’d move on.

One day when we were walking with Dr. Crosland, our general practitioner, Mickey switched his answer from no to yes. He wanted us to check his blood pressure, which we found out was alarmingly high. Mickey let us call an ambulance for him, and we later found out that he was suffering from a heart attack. Mickey stayed in the hospital for several days before being discharged.

This is why we continue to do street outreach week after week and talk to people, even if they always tell us they don’t need help. One day, they might, and we want to be there for them when they do.",https://georgetownministrycenter.org/programs/street-outreach/,info@gmcgt.org,active,,"Call for more information.

Volunteers provide meals, access to community outings, tutoring, birthday presents, holiday parties, and translation and legal services to support these families as they work towards self-sufficiency.

Participants are offered up to 24 months of communal housing, case management, linkages to legal services, immigration resources, supportive services, six months of aftercare services, including monthly contact with Betty’s House staff if needed, continued access to Dr. C’s Boutique, and linkages to community resources as needed.",https://www.nccf-cares.org/family-services/,abarney@nccf-cares.org,active,,"Call or email for more information.",,,,
